# Training React project.
This project was made as part of test challenge. It is my first own React project.
The goal was to create app for football statistic rendering, based on public API:  https://www.football-data.org/
But owing to lack of time it is not fully complete, and sometimes going wrong. I'll improve it in the future.

## To start app:

Clone the code: git clone https://github.com/Evgeny-Tokarev/footballstat

Run: npm install

In the root of project create .env file and copy the key name from .env.example file.
Then replace it's value by this free plan key value

b2dd0e14d46548faaeb560db1e55fc93

or you can get your own key from  https://www.football-data.org/

Run: npm run start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
