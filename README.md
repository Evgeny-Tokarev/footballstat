# Training React project.
This project was made as part of test challenge. It is my first own React project.
The goal was to create app for football statistic rendering, based on public API:  https://www.football-data.org/
But owing to lack of time it is not fully complete, and sometimes going wrong.

##Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
